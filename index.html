        <!-- brief introduction -->
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Kristina! I have a background in Python and C programming languages. I also have brief knowledge and have completed fairly simple programs in MIPS assembly language. I'm a huge math nerd, which seems to shock most people, but I love the process of learning and applying what I know. I also enjoy watching movies and playing video games, Minecraft has been my favorite ever since I was little. 
        </p>
